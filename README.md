# Cellular

### Cellular automata and N-Dimensional Zippers

This started out as a project for simulating cities using cellular automata, but has changed into an effort to get a comonad instance of n-dimensional zippers for the purpose of generalizing n-dimensional cellular automata.

See src/Lib.hs for 2d cellular automata and src/NZipper.hs for the Zipper implementation.
